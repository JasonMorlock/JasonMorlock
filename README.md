- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JasonMorlock
- I am a graduate of New Jersey Institute of Technology - B.S. Mechanical Engineering
- During my undergrad, I worked as a TA for the Fundementals of Engineering Design (FED101) lab for general engineering students.
- The curriculum consisted of introductory lessons in CAD, C++, and circuitry. During this time, I was involved in research with the educational team.
- We produced a robotic hand project to give our students a hands-on approach to learning.
- This project is available on my page along with a research paper we wrote for the 2023 ASEE National Conference. Please reproduce this project in your class.
